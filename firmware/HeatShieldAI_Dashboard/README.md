# HeatShieldAI Dashboard

Node.js/Express backend + a plain HTML/CSS/JS web dashboard for HeatShieldAI's
LoRa node → gateway → cloud pipeline. The gateway (`../HeatShieldAI_Gateway`)
forwards each reading it receives over LoRa from the sensor node
(`../HeatShieldAI`) to this backend's `/api/ingest` endpoint over WiFi; the
backend stores it in Firestore and serves a dashboard where each worker shows
up as a card you can click into for live parameters, a location map, and a
30-day heat-strain history.

**worker1 is reserved for the real device.** It only ever gets data from the
actual gateway forwarding real sensor readings — nothing seeds or fakes data
for it. `npm run seed` populates three *example* workers (worker2-4) with 30
days of synthetic history so the dashboard has something to demonstrate the
multi-worker view and the 30-day trend/risk features before you have weeks of
real data.

## Architecture

```
ESP32-S3 node          classic ESP32 gateway         this backend            browser
(sensors + GPS)  --LoRa-->  (WiFi)  --HTTP POST-->  Express + Firestore  <--fetch--  dashboard
```

The browser never talks to Firestore directly — it only calls this backend's
own REST API. Firebase credentials stay server-side.

## 1. Firebase setup (~5 minutes)

1. Go to the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/) → **Add project** → name it (e.g. `heatshieldai`) → **Continue** → turn off Google Analytics → **Create project**.
2. Left sidebar → **Build** → **Firestore Database** → **Create database**.
3. Pick a nearby region → **Next**.
4. Choose **Start in production mode** → **Enable**. (This backend uses a service-account key, which always bypasses Firestore security rules — you'll never need to write any. Production mode just keeps the database closed to everyone else.)
5. **⚙️ gear icon** → **Project settings** → **Service accounts** tab → **Generate new private key** → confirms and downloads a JSON file.
6. Rename it to `serviceAccountKey.json` and place it directly in this folder (`firmware/HeatShieldAI_Dashboard/`). It's gitignored — never commit it.

That's the entire Firebase side. No schema, no manual indexes.

## 2. Backend setup

```bash
cd firmware/HeatShieldAI_Dashboard
npm install
copy .env.example .env      # macOS/Linux: cp .env.example .env
```

Open `.env` and confirm:
- `PORT` — defaults to 3000.
- `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` — defaults to `./serviceAccountKey.json`, matching step 6 above.
- `INGEST_API_KEY` — optional, leave blank for now (see "Securing ingestion" below).

Run it:

```bash
npm start
```

You should see:

```
HeatShieldAI Dashboard backend listening on http://0.0.0.0:3000
  - Dashboard:       http://localhost:3000
  - Ingest endpoint: http://localhost:3000/api/ingest (POST)
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` in a browser — you'll see an empty worker grid
with a "worker1 — waiting for first reading" placeholder card until either
the gateway sends real data or you seed the example workers:

```bash
npm run seed
```

(Safe to re-run — it skips any worker that already has data. Pass
`npm run seed -- --force` to wipe and regenerate worker2-4's data.)

## 3. Point the gateway at this backend

Both the gateway and the machine running this backend need to be reachable
from each other — simplest setup is putting both on the same WiFi network.

1. Find this machine's LAN IP: `ipconfig` (Windows, look for the WiFi
   adapter's IPv4 address) or `ifconfig`/`ip addr` (macOS/Linux).
2. In `../HeatShieldAI_Gateway/src/`, copy `wifi_config.h.example` to
   `wifi_config.h` (gitignored — holds your WiFi password).
3. Fill in `HEATSHIELD_WIFI_SSID`, `HEATSHIELD_WIFI_PASSWORD`, and set
   `HEATSHIELD_BACKEND_URL` to `http://<this-machine's-LAN-IP>:3000/api/ingest`.
4. Flash the gateway (`pio run --target upload` from `HeatShieldAI_Gateway/`).
   Its Serial Monitor will print `[HTTP] Forwarded to backend.` on every
   successful reading, or a specific warning if WiFi or the backend is
   unreachable.

## Securing ingestion (optional, recommended before leaving this running unattended)

By default `/api/ingest` accepts readings from anything on your network that
knows the URL. To lock it down: pick a random string, set `INGEST_API_KEY` to
it in this project's `.env`, and set the *same* string as
`HEATSHIELD_INGEST_API_KEY` in the gateway's `wifi_config.h`. Restart the
backend and reflash the gateway. Requests without a matching `x-api-key`
header are now rejected with 401.

## What's in Firestore

```
workers/{workerId}                    -- profile + latest reading (denormalized for the grid)
workers/{workerId}/readings/{auto}    -- one doc per reading (raw, for the recent-activity table)
workers/{workerId}/dailyStats/{date}  -- running sums/counts + the heatStrainDay flag, one per UTC day
```

`workerId` is whatever the node firmware sends (see `HEATSHIELD_WORKER_ID` in
`../HeatShieldAI/src/main.cpp` — `"worker1"` by default). A worker doc is
created automatically the first time it POSTs, no manual setup needed.

## About the 30-day heat-strain indicator

Your mentor's point about long-term/chronic health effects (not just "is this
reading dangerous right now") is handled as a separate, transparent,
**rule-based** layer on top of the model — see the comment block at the top
of `src/heatStrain.js` for the full reasoning and the research it's grounded
in. Short version: the on-device TinyML model only ever sees the current
reading; this layer counts how many of the last 30 days crossed a
meaningful heat-strain threshold and buckets that into low/moderate/high, so
a pattern spanning weeks becomes visible on the dashboard even though the
model itself has no memory of past days. It's an exposure-tracking heuristic,
not a diagnosis — the dashboard's copy says so and is worth keeping honest if
you extend this.

## Project layout

```
server.js                    Express entry point
src/firebase.js              Firebase Admin SDK init
src/heatStrain.js            Shared daily-aggregate + 30-day risk logic (ingest route + seed script both use this)
src/routes/ingest.js         POST /api/ingest -- gateway's forward target
src/routes/workers.js        GET /api/workers, /api/workers/:id -- what the dashboard calls
scripts/seedDummyWorkers.js  Populates worker2-4 with 30 days of example data
scripts/syntheticPhysiology.js  Mirrors the TinyML training pipeline's class-conditional distributions
public/                      The dashboard itself (index.html, styles.css, app.js) -- served statically
```

## Troubleshooting

| Symptom | Likely cause |
|---|---|
| `Firebase service account key not found at "..."` on `npm start` | You haven't done step 6 of Firebase setup, or `FIREBASE_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_PATH` in `.env` doesn't match the filename you saved. |
| Dashboard loads but the worker grid never shows real data | Check the gateway's Serial Monitor for `[HTTP]` lines — `WiFi not connected` means check `wifi_config.h`; `Forward FAILED` means the backend URL/port is unreachable from the gateway's network. |
| `401` responses in the backend's console | `INGEST_API_KEY` is set in `.env` but the gateway's `HEATSHIELD_INGEST_API_KEY` doesn't match (or is still empty). |
| Map shows a marker but no map tiles | Needs outbound internet access to `tile.openstreetmap.org` from the browser (not from the gateway) — no API key required, just connectivity. |
| Chart/map area looks empty right after seeding | Hard-refresh the dashboard page; the grid/detail views poll every 5s but won't pick up a brand-new worker until the next poll or a manual reload. |
